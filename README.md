# Kruskal-s-Algorithm
Kruskal's Algorithm for Specified Input

The Example Input file is added to files.

For better explaining;
81    ------ Number of Nodes
Çanakkale    ---------- Name of Node (or it can be a number)
2     ------------- Number of Edges for containg Node
2 5   ------------- First number is to Node, Edge start from Çanakkale in this case first node to second node in this case İstanbul
3 4   --------------Second number is the Weight of Edge.
İstanbul
